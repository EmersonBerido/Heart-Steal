A fast-paced, two player competitive game built in a week for the Beginner's Game Jam hosted by the Game Development Club at San Francisco State University. Players must chase each other to be the only ghost holding the heart until the time runs out. Designed for browsery play with intuitive controls and immersive feedback.
